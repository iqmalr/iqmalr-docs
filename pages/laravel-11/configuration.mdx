# Laravel 11 Configuration

Laravel 11 introduces several new features and performance enhancements. To leverage them to the fullest, it's important to configure your framework properly.

## Preparation

Before you begin, make sure you have installed Laravel 11. If not, you can follow the installation guide on the previous page or by visiting `laravel.com`.

## Local Configuration

Laravel uses the `.env` file to manage environment configurations. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust the following values according to your environment:

APP_NAME=Laravel
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost
LOG_CHANNEL=stack
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

Don't forget to run `php artisan key:generate` to set the `APP_KEY`.

## Database Configuration

Laravel supports multiple database systems. You can configure your database connection in the `.env` file as shown above.

## Database Migration

After the database is configured, use migration to create your database schema:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Storage

Laravel provides an integrated file system for storing files. To create a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`, use the command:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

## Conclusion

After following the steps above, your Laravel 11 application should be configured and ready for further development. For more information on specific configurations, refer to the official Laravel documentation.
